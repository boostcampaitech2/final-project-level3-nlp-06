    "# Guide to Transformers Domain Adaptation\n",
    "This guide illustrates an end-to-end workflow of domain adaptation, where we domain-adapt a transfomer model for biomedical NLP applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It showcases the two domain adaptation techniques we investigated in our research:\n",
    "1. Data Selection\n",
    "2. Vocabulary Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that, we demonstrate how such a domain-adapted Transformers model is compatible with 🤗 `transformers`'s training interface and how it outperforms an out-of-the-box (non-domain adapted) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are applied to BERT small but the codebase is written to be generalizable to other classes of Transformers supported by HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "For this guide, we use a much smaller subset (<0.05%) of the in-domain corpora due to memory and time constraints. "

       "'Chlorophyll content,leaf mass to per area,net photosynthetic rate and bioactive ingredients of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum,a skiophyte grown in four levels of solar irradiance were measured and analyzed in order to investigate the response of photosynthetic capability to light irradiance and other environmental factors. It suggested that the leaf mass to per area of plant was greatest value of four kinds of light irradiance and decreasing intensity of solar irradiance resulted in the decrease of leaf mass to per area at every phenological stage. At expanding leaf stage,the rate of Chla and Chlb was 3. 11 when A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum grew in full light irradiance which is similar to the rate of heliophytes,however,the rate of Chla and Chlb was below to 3. 0 when they grew in shading environment. The content of Chla,Chlb and Chl( a+b) was the greatest value of four kinds of light irradiance and decreasing intensity of solar irradiance resulted in its decreasing remarkably( P<0. 05). The rate of Chla and Chlb decreased but the content of Chla,Chlb and Chl( a+b) increased gradually with continued shading. The maximum value of photosynthetically active radiation appeared at 10: 00-12: 00 am in a day. The maximum value of net photosynthetic rate appeared at 8: 30-9: 00 am and the minimum value appeared at 14: 00-14: 30 pm at each phenological stage if plants grew in full sunlight. However,when plants grew in shading,the maximum value of net photosynthetic rate appeared at about 10: 30 am and the minimum value appeared at 12: 20-12: 50 pm at each phenological stage. At expanding leaf stage and flowering stage,the average of net photosynthetic rate of leaves in full sunlight was remarkably higher than those in shading and it decreased greatly with decreasing of irradiance gradually( P < 0. 05). However,at fruiting stage,the average of net photosynthetic rate of leaves in full sunlight was lower than those in 50% and 28% full sunlight but higher than those in 12% full sunlight. All photosynthetic diurnal variation parameters of plants measured in four kinds of different irradiance at three stages were used in correlation analysis. The results suggested that no significant correlation was observed between net photosynthetic rate and photosynthetically active radiation,and significant negative correlation was observed between net photosynthetic rate and environmental temperature as well as vapor pressure deficit expect for 12% full sunlight. Positive correlation was observed between net photosynthestic rate and relative humidity expect for 12% full sunlight. Significant positive correlation was observed between net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance in the four light treatments. Only,in 12% full sunlight,the net photosynthetic rate was significantly related to photosynthetically active radiation rather than related to environmental temperature,vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity. In each light treatment,a significant positive correlation was observed between environmental temperature and vapor pressure deficit,relative humidity as well as stomatal conductance. Volatile oil content was 1. 46%,2. 16%,1. 56%,1. 30% respectively. ethanol extracts was 23. 44%,22. 45%,22. 18%,21. 12% respectively. Asarinin content was 0. 281%,0. 291%,0. 279% and 0. 252% respectively. The characteristic components of Asarum volatile oil of plant in different light treatments did not change significantly among different groups.'"
